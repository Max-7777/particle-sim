To run:

Intellij:
Open project 
Define SDK as ver. 16
Settings -> Invalidate caches (invalidate & restart)
Run main

Eclipse:
Open Project 
Run main

Make core.jar a dependency/library if not already


Particle Simulator:

Load: to load file from 'default/particles' click load button and type in name of file (ex: 'bubbles1')
Save: to save to 'default/particles' click save button and type in desired file name (ex: 'bubbles2')

Add pngs to 'default/shapes' to be able to load in that image for particle sprites

'u': Toggle ui

Settings Info:

Draw wireframe: Draws wireframe around spawn area and direction of velocity of particles
Spawn position: Spawn position of particles
Spawn shape size: Size of spawn range of particles
Spawn time range: Range of random times between particle spawns
Particle lifetime: Lifetime of particles
Pulse: Whether particles spawn all at once or not
Reset time: Time between pulses
Spawn amount: Amount of particles spawned each pulse

Size range: Range of random sizes of particles
Color: Color of particles
Color range: Range of color of particles (ex: Color: 100, Color Range: 100, results in color values between 50, 150)
Opacity: Opacity of particles
Sprite: Sprite of particles (ex: 'circle.png')

Follow mouse: Whether particles follow mouse

Vel. range: Range of random velocities of particles
Vel. angle: Angle of particle velocity in radians
Vel. spread: Range of angles of particles' velocities (ex: Vel. angle: 1.5, Vel. spread: 3, results in random angles between 0,3)
Vel. friction: Friction of particles' velocities
Vel. rotate: Rotation velocity of particles
Rotate friction: Friction of particles' rotation velocities
Applied force: Applied acceleration to particles

Lifetime size: Sliders controlling size of particles over particle lifetime (left -> right)
Lifetime opacity: Sliders controlling opacity of particles over particle lifetime (left -> right)
